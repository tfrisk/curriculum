OS X Setup
==========

* Start a terminal
* Make sure Java is installed
* Get Leiningen installed
* Get LightTable installed
* Test installation

## Starting a terminal

For these instructions, and for much of the class, you will need to have a terminal, or command line, open. This is a text-based interface to talk to your computer, and you can open it by running Terminal.app, which is found under `/Applications/Utilities`. If you have never used the terminal before, you may want to spend some time [reading up on command-line basics](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/command-line-basics).

Go ahead and open your terminal now. It should look something like this:

![blank terminal](img/os_x/blank_terminal.png)

The prompt (where you will type your commands) may look different: it usually shows the computer name and user name, as well as the folder or directory you are currently in.

For the rest of this setup, I will tell you to run commands in your terminal. When I say that, I mean "type the command into the terminal and press the Return key."

## Making sure Java is installed

Run `java -version` in your terminal. If you do not have Java installed, OS X will prompt you to install it. Follow all of the directions OS X gives you, then return to this part of the tutorial and run `java -version` again.

If Java is installed, you will see something like this in your terminal:

![Java version](img/os_x/java_version.png)

The details of Java's version may differ from what you see above; that is perfectly fine.

## Installing Leiningen

Leiningen is a tool used on the command line to manage Clojure projects.

To install `lein`, execute the following commands in your terminal. You will be prompted to enter your password.

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein > lein
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin/
sudo mv lein /usr/local/bin/lein
sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/lein
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin
```

After you run the above commands, run the `lein version` command. It should take a while to run, as it will download some resources it needs the first time. If it completes successfully, you are golden! If not, ask an instructor for help.

## Installing Light Table

Go to the [LightTable site](http://www.lighttable.com/). On the page there, you should see a set of buttons that have download links for Light Table. Click the "OS X 10.7+" button and you will download a .zip file.

![Light Table downloads Mac](img/os_x/light-table-download.png)

There should now be a file named LightTableMac.zip in your Downloads folder. Double-click the file to unzip it, then move LightTable.app to your Applications folder.

The first time you launch LightTable you will be presented with a confirmation
prompt. Click "Open".

## Testing your setup

You have set up Java, Leiningen and LightTable on your computer--all the tools you will need for this course. Before starting, we need to test them out.

Go to your terminal and run the following command:

```
lein repl
```

This could take a long time, and will download many other pieces of code it relies on. You should see lines that start with `Retrieving ...` on your screen. When it finishes, your terminal should look like the following:

![Testing lein repl](img/os_x/testing-step2.png)

This is starting a REPL, which we will learn about soon. It's a special terminal for Clojure. At the REPL prompt, type `(+ 1 1)` and press Return. Did you get the answer `2` back? You will learn more about that in the course. For now, press the Control button and D button on your keyboard together (abbreviated as Ctrl+D). This should take you out of the Clojure REPL and back to your normal terminal prompt. `user=> Bye for now!`

Now, start Applications > LightTable. Once it is started, press the Control button and Space Bar together (abbreviated Ctrl+Space). This is how you start giving LightTable a command. Start typing the word "instarepl" and you should see a menu of options, like below. Choose "Instarepl: open a clojure instarepl."

![Testing LightTable - starting instarepl](img/os_x/testing-step3.png)

At the bottom left of the screen, you will see a cube moving and some text about connecting, retrieving and installing dependencies. Wait until that stops moving, then type `(+ 1 1)` into the window. It should look like the following image:

![Testing LightTable - running in the instarepl](img/os_x/testing-step4.png)

If that worked, great! Close LightTable. 

Congratulations! Your computer is all set up.
